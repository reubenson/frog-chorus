# We Are Sitting In A Pond

In 1982, the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, presented the first of his sound installations based on frogs, in which each, in a set of over thirty robots, is outfitted with a microphone, speaker, and circuitry to allow it to listen to its environment and chirp together in the manner of a frog chorus. 

That same year, he published his first cassette tape of Australian frog field recordings, [*Frogs 1*](https://www.discogs.com/release/2383064-Felix-Hess-Frogs-1), on the enigmatic [Taal Beeld Geluid](https://www.discogs.com/label/204315-Taal-Beeld-Geluid) tape label, better known for publishing recordings of kinetic guitar sculptures by the computational linguist [Remko Scha](https://blacktruffle.bandcamp.com/album/guitar-mural-1-feat-the-machines). Like Remko, Felix's interest seemed to lie in the emergent complexity of a dynamic system composed of simple agents. And while Remko's work on [Data-oriented Parsing](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/D/bo3619719.html) has been foundational to the development of large language models like GPT^1^, Felix's work, too, has engaged questions of how a machine can be more like a living creature [cite Electronic Sound Creatures]. 

> The acoustic communications between animals like frogs, cicadas, or grasshoppers often give rise to group concerts or choruses. Both order and chaos appear to be present in the resulting sound patterns, and one may notice various rhythms and wavelike movements. Similar group processes can be realised with machines built specifically for such a purpose. - Felix Hess, [Electronic Sound Creatures](https://alife.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/collections_ECAL93-0452-0457-Hess.pdf)

I first encountered Felix Hess's frogs some ten years ago while researching artists along the outer edges of post-war European sound art. With his background and predominant career in physics, his work posseses an aesthetic sensibility similar to that of [Alvin Lucier](https://www.documenta14.de/en/artists/5877/alvin-lucier), organized around an interest in showing the physics of sound as simply as possible. However, Felix's attention to embodied perception and the qualities of attention itself, align him more closely with Pauline Oliveros, whose practice and advocacy of Deep Listening is predicated on balancing two modes of attention: focal and global.

> Her holistic approach to making music is a testament to the generative powers of listening, noticing, improvisation and responding to what is already here rather than seeking to overwrite it - [Claire-Louise Bennett on Pauline Oliveros](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-the-recordings-of-pauline-oliveros.html)

I've built this project as an homage to Felix, who passed away in December 2022, but I also wish to leave an impression of an implicit critique: in an age where machines are unquestionably embued with a sense of aliveness, what of our own aliveness is inexectricably subjected to the logic of machines? And what of our aliveness is constituted in our attention? Or, as the psychiatrist and neuroscience researcher Iain McGilchrist puts it "[...] the nature of attention alters what it finds; and specifically that when we cease to act, to be involved, spontaneous, and intuitive, and instead become passive, disengaged, self-conscious, and stare in an 'objective' fashion at the world around us, it becomes bizarre, alien, frightening -- and curiously similar to the mental world of the schizophrenic".

The hope, here, is to offer an exercise in exploring the question of what humans are left to do while machines do all the talking. If Dark Forests on the web continue to evolve in offering spaces to engage without context collapse, while also opting out of the ingestion pipelines of large language models, consider this project as creating a pond inside of a dark forest. A pond as an ephemeral social architecture, which depending on environmental conditions, may only sometimes defy the tendency to dry up or succumb to algal blooms, but otherwise providing a site for gathering.

To bring things back to the frogs, Felix says it best himself: "The complexity of my electronic 'sound creatures' is nothing compared to that of any biological system [...] I developed them as a means to investigate the nature of listening. Through actually building machines such as the 'sound creatures' one can get a 'feel' for the relationship between sensitivity and intelligence. This work has only increased my respect for the frogs, who taught me to sit in silence and listen."





<!--[dark forest](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) spaces on the web thrive alongside the long-tail of Web-2 institutions.-->

The development of this project came about as I was getting ready to leave my job of seven years as a software engineer and engineering manager at [New York Magazine](https://nymag.com), and pondering over my own engagement with the web as someone working within it. You may notice that I've borrowed some design elements from an older internet, which I intend as a gesture towards a more hand-made web, in which the exercise of building a website is performed simply for pleasure of doing so and getting to share with others. 

I'm inclined to see the internet as constantly working through tensions between degrees of centralization and de-centralization, which are fundamentally unresolvable. It may be helpful to consider that even during the early days of Web2.0, bloggers like Rebecca Blood were compelled to comment: "Dear Everyone: Please stop creating compelling content. Much appreciated, thanks! in a [blog post titled 'I am a slave to my RSS reader' on April 9th, 2007](http://www.rebeccablood.net/archive/2007/04/i_am_a_slave_to_my_rss_reader_1.html), written on April 9th, 2007, eight years after the RSS spec had first been developed, and [five years after its adoption at the *New York Times*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565593/#:~:text=RSS%20has%20been%20around%20in,RSS%20feeds%20on%20its%20website).

In this attitude, the motivating force behind this project has been towards a slower, [calmer web](https://calmtech.com/).

It's been a long time since the metaphor of the web felt meaningful, as web2 pushed us towards the timeline, the feed, and now, the oceanic masses of large language models. Leaving all that aside, I'd like to consider a different archetype: the pond.

The pond as ephemeral social architecture, which depending on environmental conditions, may dry up, or succumb to algal blooms that reduce the biodiversity of the pond. A temporary site for gathering. By translating Felix’s frogs to our world of mobile devices, the intention here is to instantiate the web as a pond, as ephemeral social architecture.

[1] When asking ChatGPT (04/15/2023), "How foundational is the work of Remko Scha in the development of large language models like GPT?", it responded in summary, "Remko Scha's work has been foundational in the development of large language models like GPT by providing key insights and concepts related to linguistic knowledge representation, computational semiotics, cognitive modeling, and language generation, which have influenced the architecture, design, and training methodologies of these models."

## A suggestion for how to use this app
In a gathering of five or more people:

Walk in a slow undirected manner with your frog until you find a good place to set your phone down. Walk around between the phones, imagining traversing the ‘web’ of phones. Try to pick out the sound of your frog, apart from the other frogs. Walk further away from your phone, noticing how it becomes harder to pick your frog out from the crowd. Instead of a web, imagine a pond encircling the cluster of phones from a further distance. Imagine each phone sitting in that pond sending ripples back and forth. Notice how content the phones seem just chirping amongst themselves. After a while, consider either leaving the pond, or leaving your phone indefinitely.
